Basic ring buffer
===================

Two implementations are provided, a C and a C++ implementation. The C++
implementation is far more flexible, as it utilizes C++'s templating engine.
The C implementation may need some modification to suit your needs.

Using the C++ version
=======================
Copy the header file in your project. Include the header file in any file where
you use the ring buffer.

#include "ringbuffer.hpp"

Proceed to declare a ring buffer. You must pass the template arguments. The
first argument is the type you wish the ring buffer to store, the second
argument is the size of the ring buffer.

ringbuffer<int, 32> rb;

Proceed to use the ring buffer by accessing its methods:

rb.put(10);			// places 10 to the ring buffer
					// this method will throw an exception if the ring buffer
					// is full
myvar = rb.get();	// gets a value from the tail of the ring buffer
					// this method will throw an exception if the ring buffer
					// is empty
rb.empty()			// returns true if the ring buffer is empty
rb.full()			// returns true if the ring buffer is full

Using the C version
=====================
You must copy the header file and the file containing the implementation in
your project. You must include the header file in any file where you utilize
the ring buffer.

#include "ringbuffer.h"

Proceed to declare a ring buffer:

struct ringbuffer rb;

Then initialize it:

rb_init(&rb);

Proceed to use the ring buffer by using the ring buffer functions:

rb_put(&rb, 10);		/* places 10 into the ring buffer
						 * this function will return 0 upon success and non-zero
						 * upon failure (ring buffer is full)
						 */
myvar = rb_get(&rb);	/* gets the value at the tail of the ring bufer
						 * this method will return a sentinel if the ring
						 * buffer is empty
						 */
rb_empty(&rb)			/* returns non-zero if the ring buffer is empty */
rb_full(&rb)			/* returns non-zero if the ring buffer is full */

Notice that all the functions take a pointer to the ring buffer as the first
argument!

Changing the C implementation
===============================
Edit the constant BUFFERSIZE to match the desired size of the ring buffer.

Edit the struct defining the ring buffer to contain the type you wish to
utilize. Example:

struct ringbuffer {
	size_t head;
	size_t tail;
	size_t count;
	struct my_type container[BUFFERSIZE];
};

Change the signature of the rb_put() function to match your type. If using an
aggregate type such as a struct, you may want to pass a pointer to the
aggregate type instead of a copy of the object:

int rb_put(struct ringbuffer* rb, const struct my_type* value);

Change the implementation of the rb_put() function to act accordingly. Example:

int rb_put(struct ringbuffer* rb, const struct my_type* value) {
	/* checks remain the same */
	rb->container[rb->head].first_aggregate = value->first_aggregate;
	rb->container[rb->head].second_aggregate = value->second_aggregate;
	/* ... */
}


Change the signature of the rb_get() function to match your type. If using an
aggregate type such as a struct, you may want to return a pointer to the
aggregate type instead of a copy of the object:

const struct my_type* rb_get(const struct ringbuffer* rb);

Change the implementation of the rb_get() function to act accordingly. Example:

const struct my_type* rb_get(const struct ringbuffer* rb) {
	if(rb_empty(rb)) {
		/* return NULL if the buffer is full */
		return (struct my_type*)NULL;
	}
	/* tail modifications remain the same */
	return &(rb->container[rb->tail]);
}
